<h2>HTML Links</h2>
<p>HTML links are hyperlinks.<br>
    You can click on a link and jump to another document.<br>
    When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.<br>
    Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!</p>
<h2>HTML Links - Syntax</h2>
<p>The HTML (a) tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:</p>
<p>(a href="url")This how you make a link(/a)"</p>
<p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:<br>
    <br>
    An unvisited link is underlined and blue<br>
    A visited link is underlined and purple<br>
    An active link is underlined and red</p>
